# pd-patches
puredata patches i still use

These patches are works in progress that need some fixing before they're good to go and general-case enough to be useful to others. 

As far as I know, Soundscapev2.2 is very close to being "finished" and should make sense. I still need to add pd HELP pages on it.

The others are basically one-night marathon mistakes. The videoDJ one is the pinaccle of a thrown together piece of shit. It'll run out of RAM if you load > 20 videos at once. I would definitely reccomend an SSD and a modern GPU chipset. I would also recommend you never try to run it. Its awful.
